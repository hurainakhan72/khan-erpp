### PATCH /penalties/:id/ack

Acknowledge a penalty (employee confirmation of receipt). Once approved, employees can acknowledge that they've seen the penalty. This is a simple acknowledgment action.

**Authentication:** Required  
**Permissions:** None (any authenticated user can ack their own penalties)

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description               |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------- |
| `id`      | UUID | Penalty ID to acknowledge |

### Request Body

None.

### Response Body

**Success (200 OK):**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "e3f4a5b6-c7d8-9012-ef34-567890123456",
    "status": "acknowledged",
    "acknowledged_by": "EMP002",
    "acknowledged_at": "2025-05-06T11:00:00.000Z",
    "message": "Penalty acknowledged"
  }
}
```

**Note:** Acknowledgment does not change the `status` field; it's a separate flag indicating the employee has viewed it. The actual status remains `approved`.

**Example cURL:**

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3001/api/penalties/e3f4a5b6-c7d8-9012-ef34-567890123456/ack \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
```

  - `penalties:propose` allows viewing rules and proposing penalties
  - `penalties:read_all` for viewing all penalties
  - `penalties:read_own` for employees to see only their own
  - `penalties:review` for managers to approve/reject
- **Status Values:** `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `acknowledged`
- **Audit Trail:** All actions are tracked with `*_by` and `*_at` fields.
