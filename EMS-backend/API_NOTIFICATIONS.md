## Permissions

The following permissions control access to notifications endpoints. These are assigned via the master seed (`seeds/master_seed.js`):

| Permission | Description | Roles |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `notifications:read` | View notifications | HR Manager, HR Executive, IT Manager, Software Engineering Manager, Tech Lead, Employee |
| `notifications:write` | Create notifications | HR Manager, HR Executive |

**Note:** The seed assigns these role permissions but does not generate sample notifications. Notifications are created dynamically by the system (e.g., leave approvals, penalty assignments) or via the POST endpoint by authorized users.

---

## Notes

- **Targeting:** Notifications can be targeted to a specific user (`user_id`) or broadcast to all users with a specific `role`. The system uses this to send leave approvals, penalty assignments, etc.
- **Unread Count:** Frontend apps typically query this endpoint and filter by `is_read: false` to show notification badges/counts.
- **Scope Parameter:** Currently only `scope=me` is supported. This is a required query parameter for the GET endpoint.
- **Automatic Notifications:** The system automatically creates notifications when:
  - Leave request is approved/rejected
  - Penalty is assigned and when approved
  - Attendance sheet is submitted/unlocked
  - System-wide announcements from admins
- **Mark as Read:** The `PATCH /notifications/:id/read` endpoint simply flips `is_read` to `true` and records `read_at`. Users can also bulk mark as read via frontend (multiple parallel calls).
- **Deletion:** Notifications are typically not deleted but kept for audit purposes. Old notifications may be archived by system admin.
