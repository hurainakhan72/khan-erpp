## Notes

- **Capacity Check:** When submitting a leave request, the system checks if department capacity would be exceeded. If so, the request returns `409 Conflict` with details about which dates are over capacity.
- **Date Range:** `start_date` and `end_date` are inclusive. A request from May 20 to May 25 counts as 5 days (20, 21, 22, 23, 24).
- **Balance Validation:** The system validates that sufficient leave balance exists before allowing submission. If balance is insufficient, returns `400 Bad Request`.
- **Status Flow:** `pending` → `approved` or `rejected`. Early returns change status to `ended_early`.
- **Auto-Deduction:** Upon approval, the approved days are automatically deducted from the employee's leave balance for that leave type and year.
- **Re-Credit:** If a leave is rejected after being approved (rare), or ended early, days are credited back to the balance.
